# GunpowderMod

A mod for *The Long Dark* that allows gunpowder to be crafted at any workbench.

## Features

- Allows you to craft gunpowder at regular workbenches instead of at the Ammunition Workbench.

## Installation

1. If you haven't done so already, install MelonLoader by downloading and running [MelonLoader.Installer.exe](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe)
2. Download the latest version of `GunpowderMod.dll` from the [releases page](https://github.com/ds5678/GunpowderMod/releases)

## Note

This was my first mod. It has since been incorporated into [Cannery Manufacturing](https://github.com/ds5678/CanneryManufacturing).

## Special Thanks

I want to give my special thanks to [zeobviouslyfakeacc](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc) and [ttr](https://github.com/ttr). Their projects, [TinCanImprovements](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/TinCanImprovements) and [ArrowMod](https://github.com/ttr/tld-ArrowMod), inspired me to make this mod which borrows some of their base code.
